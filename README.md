# README

This is the Java 21 project template I use with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as the build tool. It has [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) as the testing framework. and [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) to provide more powerful assertions.

## Installation
1. Install directly using Maven using ```mvn clean install```.
2. Run the included pom.xml with IDE of choice

## Testing
Tests can be ran using ``` mvn clean test```
